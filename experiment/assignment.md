1. Introduce delays in the XOR circuit and analyze the impact on the output waveform. Experiment with different delay values and observe changes in signal timing.
2. Modify the existing XOR circuit to implement a half-adder using SPICE. Include inputs for two bits and outputs for both the sum and carry.
3. Combine multiple XOR and XNOR circuits to create a 4-bit binary adder. Simulate the addition of two 4-bit binary numbers and analyze the output.
4. Design a 2-bit magnitude comparator using XOR and XNOR gates. Simulate the circuit and verify its correctness for all possible input combinations.
5. Investigate how temperature variations affect the performance of the XOR and XNOR circuits. Simulate the circuits at different temperature levels and analyze any variations in output.
